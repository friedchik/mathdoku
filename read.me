This is my game on a website, which is called Mathdoku. I used HTML5 , CSS and Javacript to code my game.
In this game, there will be a 9x9 grid that ask the uers to put all the numbers that they think it suitable in the box. 
If the number is entered display incorrect: 
It dislays a sudden red highlight that represents wrong in that position, 
if user enters the right number then it count will increment by one each time.
